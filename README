tint2-wsdisplay
===============

Small "workspace display" program, intended to be used with the Tint2 panel as
an executor command.  Active workspace is displayed as a coloured dot,
workspaces with windows on them are another colour, and workspaces with no
windows on them are are not the active workspace are greyed out.

Currently intended to be used with 9 workspaces (displayed in a 3x3 grid), and
all additional workspaces will be hidden from the display.  If using less than
9 workspaces it may be desireable to edit the source code to arrange the dots
differently, instead of in the 3x3 grid.

See config.h for customisation options via the preprocessor.  Remember to
recompile for any changes to take effect (and restart your Tint2 panel).

Note that since this program prints the dots using text (a unicode character),
the selection of font is important.  Ideally you'd want to create your own font
font (e.g. with FontForge) so you have full control over the metrics.  It would
be a bit hacky but it'd work.

Example in tint2rc configuration

  #-------------------------------------
  # Executor: workspace display
  execp = new
  execp_command = /path/to/binary//tint2-wsdisplay
  # note this is set to number of lines; we output 3 lines from the program
  execp_continuous = 3
  execp_interval = 0
  # required for colours
  execp_markup = 1
  execp_font = Noto Sans Regular 3
  execp_has_icon = 0
  execp_font_color = #ffffff 100
  execp_padding = 0 0
  execp_background_id = 0
